# Getting started with Security Advisor (experimental)
{: #index}

Hit the ground running with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Security Advisor.
{:shortdesc}

Security Advisor is available in the US South region.
{:tip}

1. [Log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://console.bluemix.net).
2. In the dashboard menu, select **Security**
3. In the Security Advisor tile, click **Launch Advisor**
4. View security information from integrated tools.



Don't have any tools yet? With a few setup steps you can monitor:

- Certificates that you manage with {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}}
- Vulnerabilities in container images that are stored in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}
- Technology preview: Suspicious clients and server IPs communicating with a Kubernetes cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}

Go ahead and [set up any of the missing tools](setup.html).

You can also [learn more](about.html) about what you get from Security Advisor, and [provide user feedback in developerWorks](troubleshooting.html#getting-help-and-support) to enhance Security Advisor as it develops.
